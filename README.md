# Natural Language Understanding benchmark

This repository contains the results of two benchmarks: 
1. a comparison of natural language understanding services offering **built-in solutions** (Apple’s SiriKit, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Luis, Google’s API.ai, and Snips’ SDK) for the intents covered by the [Snips SDK](https://sdk.snips.ai/). This benchmark and its results are described in length in the [following post](
https://snips.ai/content/sdk-benchmark-visualisation/).
2. a comparison of natural understanding services offering **custom solutions** (a naive model based on regular expressions, Lastmile's RASA NLU, Recast.ai, and Snips' Pcfg parser)

The data is provided for each benchmark and more details about the methods are available in the README file in each folder.
