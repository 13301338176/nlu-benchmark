# Natural Language Understanding benchmark

This file contains the results of the benchmark we ran on June 1st 2017 to compare natural language understanding services offering custom solutions (Wit, Luis, Api, and Snips) for seven intents. This benchmark and its results are described in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@alicecoucke/benchmarking-natural-language-understanding-systems-google-facebook-microsoft-and-snips-2b8ddcf9fb19).

We focused on seven `intents`:
* SearchCreativeWork (e.g. Find me the I, Robot television show),
* GetWeather (e.g. Is it windy in Boston, MA right now?),
* BookRestaurant (e.g. I want to book a highly rated restaurant for me and my boyfriend tomorrow night)
* PlayMusic (e.g. Play the last track from Beyonc√© off Spotify)
* AddToPlaylist (e.g. Add Diamonds to my roadtrip playlist)
* RateBook (e.g. Give 6 stars to Of Mice and Men)
* SearchScreeningEvent (e.g. Check the showtimes for Wonder Woman in Paris)

More than 2000 queries have been generated for each intent with crowdsourcing methods. 10, 20, 50, 70, and around 2000 (depending on the intent) queries have been randomly selected several times to train the competitors. The training sets up to 70 queries are drawn among the train_intent.json files, and the ~2000 are provided by the train_intent_full.json files.

The results of the benchmark are displayed on the different `metrics` files, one per each intent and competitor. More specifically, the `precision` and `recall` are displayed for each `slot`.
Each value is displayed 3 times, corresponding to the number of random samples selected for each training size. 

### Disclaimer
This benchmark has been run by Snips, which is one of the solutions benchmarked. To avoid biases in responses, this benchmark has been run in a blindfolded way, by a team independent from the data scientists working on the problem. The raw data is provided here to guarantee transparency.
